<sub> I'm a lecturer (equivalent to assistant professor in US) in the University of Western Australia. Prior to that, I was Research Scientist at CSIRO's Data61, Australia. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of New South Wales, Australia. My research interests are in the areas of system security, rowhammer, and adversarial artificial intelligence.
